# Target Audience

Think about your target audience. It always helps to have one core audience you will be designing for. For example; sport fanatics to match people based on sports, netflixers to match people based on what series they want to watch etc.

- Wat weet je over deze doelgroep?
  Het zijn mensen van elke laag van de maatschappij met een gemiddelde leeftijd tussen de 18 en 35 jaar.
- What are their wishes and challenges?
- Can you find more information about them online?
- Can you talk to a few members of your target audience to ask them what they think is important?
